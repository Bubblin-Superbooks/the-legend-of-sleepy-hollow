Certain it is, his advances were signals for rival candidates to retire, who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his amours; insomuch, that when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel&rsquo;s paling, on a Sunday night, a sure sign that his master was courting, or, as it is termed, &ldquo;sparking,&rdquo; within, all other suitors passed by in despair, and carried the war into other quarters.</p><p>Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend, and, considering all things, a stouter man than he would have shrunk from the competition, and a wiser man would have despaired.</p></div> </div>
